== Running a Task App on Cloud Foundry

The simplest way to launch a Spring Cloud Task application as a task on Cloud Foundry
is to use Spring Cloud Data Flow.  Via Spring Cloud Data Flow you can register your task application,
create a definition for it and then launch it.  You then can track the task execution(s)
via a RESTful API, the Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell, or the UI.  To learn out to get started
follow the instructions in the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started[Getting Started]
section of the reference documentation.
