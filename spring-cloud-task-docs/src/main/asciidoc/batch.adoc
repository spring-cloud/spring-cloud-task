This section goes into more detail about Spring Cloud Task's integrations with Spring
Batch.  Tracking the association between a job execution and the task it was executed
within as well as remote partitioning via Spring Cloud Deployer are all covered within
this section.

[[batch-association]]
== Associating A Job Execution To The Task In Which It Was Executed

Spring Boot provides facilities for the execution of batch jobs easily within an 端ber-jar.
Spring Boot's support of this functionality allows for a developer to execute multiple
batch jobs within that execution.  Spring Cloud Task provides the ability to associate the
execution of a job (a job execution) with a task's execution so that one can be traced
back to the other.

This functionality is accomplished by using the `TaskBatchExecutionListener`.  By default,
this listener is auto configured in any context that has both a Spring Batch Job configured
(via having a bean of type `Job` defined in the context) and the spring-cloud-task-batch jar
is available within the classpath.  The listener will be injected into all jobs.

[[batch-association-override]]
=== Overriding the TaskBatchExecutionListener

To prevent the listener from being injected into any batch jobs within the current context,
the autoconfiguration can be disabled via standard Spring Boot mechanisms.

To only have the listener injected into particular jobs within the context, the
`batchTaskExecutionListenerBeanPostProcessor` may be overridden and a list of job bean ids
can be provided:

```
public TaskBatchExecutionListenerBeanPostProcessor batchTaskExecutionListenerBeanPostProcessor() {
	TaskBatchExecutionListenerBeanPostProcessor postProcessor =
		new TaskBatchExecutionListenerBeanPostProcessor();

	postProcessor.setJobNames(Arrays.asList(new String[] {"job1", "job2"}));

	return postProcessor;
}
```
NOTE: A sample batch application can be found in the samples module
of the Spring Cloud Task Project
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-task/tree/master/spring-cloud-task-samples/batch-job[here].


[[batch-partitioning]]
== Remote Partitioning

Spring Cloud Deployer provides facilities for launching Spring Boot based applications on
most cloud infrastructures.  The `DeployerPartitionHandler` and
`DeployerStepExecutionHandler` delegate the launching of worker step executions to Spring
Cloud Deployer.

To configure the `DeployerStepExecutionHandler`, a `Resource` representing the Spring Boot
端ber-jar to be executed, a `TaskLauncher`, and a `JobExplorer` are all required.  You can
configure any environment properties as well as the max number of workers to be executing
at once, the interval to poll for the results (defaults to 10 seconds), and a timeout
(defaults to -1 or no timeout).  An example of configuring this `PartitionHandler` would
look like the following:

```

@Bean
public PartitionHandler partitionHandler(TaskLauncher taskLauncher,
		JobExplorer jobExplorer) throws Exception {

	MavenProperties mavenProperties = new MavenProperties();
	mavenProperties.setRemoteRepositories(new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap("springRepo",
		new MavenProperties.RemoteRepository(repository))));

 	Resource resource =
		MavenResource.parse(String.format("%s:%s:%s",
				"io.spring.cloud",
				"partitioned-batch-job",
				"1.1.0.GA"), mavenProperties);

	DeployerPartitionHandler partitionHandler =
		new DeployerPartitionHandler(taskLauncher, jobExplorer, resource, "workerStep");

	List<String> commandLineArgs = new ArrayList<>(3);
	commandLineArgs.add("--spring.profiles.active=worker");
	commandLineArgs.add("--spring.cloud.task.initialize.enable=false");
	commandLineArgs.add("--spring.batch.initializer.enabled=false");

	partitionHandler.setCommandLineArgsProvider(new PassThroughCommandLineArgsProvider(commandLineArgs));
	partitionHandler.setEnvironmentVariablesProvider(new NoOpEnvironmentVariablesProvider());
	partitionHandler.setMaxWorkers(2);
	partitionHandler.setApplicationName("PartitionedBatchJobTask");

	return partitionHandler;
}
```
NOTE: When passing environment variables to partitions, each partition may
 be on a different machine with a different environment settings.
 So only pass those that are required.

The `Resource` to be executed is expected to be a Spring Boot 端ber-jar with a
`DeployerStepExecutionHandler` configured as a `CommandLineRunner` in the current context.
The repository enumerated in the example above should be the location of the remote repository
from which the 端ber-jar is located. Both the master and slave are expected to have
visibility into the same data store being used as the job repository and task repository.
Once the underlying infrastructure has bootstrapped the Spring Boot jar and Spring Boot
has launched the `DeployerStepExecutionHandler`, the step handler will execute the Step
requested.  An example of configuring the `DefaultStepExecutionHandler` is show below:

```
@Bean
public DeployerStepExecutionHandler stepExecutionHandler(JobExplorer jobExplorer) {
	DeployerStepExecutionHandler handler =
		new DeployerStepExecutionHandler(this.context, jobExplorer, this.jobRepository);

	return handler;
}
```
NOTE: A sample remote partition application can be found in the samples module
of the Spring Cloud Task Project
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-task/tree/master/spring-cloud-task-samples/partitioned-batch-job[here].

=== Notes on developing a batch partitioned app for the Yarn platform

* When deploying partitioned apps on the Yarn platform be sure to use the
following dependency for the Spring Cloud Yarn Deployer
(with a version 1.0.2 or higher):
```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-deployer-yarn</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
* Add the following dependency to the dependency management for a transient dependency required by Yarn:
```
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
            <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
            <version>18.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
...
</dependencyManagement>
```
* Also add the following property to your application.properties: `spring.yarn.container.keepContextAlive=false`.
* When setting up environment variables for the partitions in the PartitionHandler it is recommended that you do not
copy the current working environment properties.

=== Notes on developing a batch partitioned app for the Kubernetes platform
* When deploying partitioned apps on the Kubernetes platform be sure to use the
following dependency for the Spring Cloud Kubernetes Deployer:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-deployer-kubernetes</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

* Application name for the task application and its partitions  need to follow
the following regex pattern `[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])`.
Else an exception will be thrown.

=== Notes on developing a batch partitioned app for the Mesos platform
* When deploying partitioned apps on the Mesos platform be sure to use the
following dependency for the Spring Cloud Mesos Deployer:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-deployer-mesos</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

* When configuring the partition handler, do not add any command line arguments to
the `CommandLineArgsProvider`.  This is due to Chronos adding the command line
args to the Mesos ID. Thus when launching the partition on Mesos this can cause
the partition to fail to start if command line arg contains characters such as
`/` or `:`.

=== Notes on developing a batch partitioned app for the Cloud Foundry platform
* When deploying partitioned apps on the Cloud Foundry platform be sure to use
the following dependencies for the Spring Cloud Cloud Foundry Deployer:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-deployer-cloudfoundry</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactor-core</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.2.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor.ipc</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactor-netty</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.1.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

* When configuring the partition handler, Cloud Foundry Deployment
environment variables need to be established so that the partition handler
can start the partitions. The following list shows the required environment
variables:
- spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_url
- spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_org
- spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_space
- spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_domain
- spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_username
- spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_password
- spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_services
- spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_taskTimeout

An example set of deployment environment variables for a partitioned task that
uses a `mysql` database service would look something like this:

```
spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_url=https://api.local.pcfdev.io
spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_org=pcfdev-org
spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_space=pcfdev-space
spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_domain=local.pcfdev.io
spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_username=admin
spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_password=admin
spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_services=mysql
spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_taskTimeout=300
```

NOTE: When using PCF-Dev the following environment variable is also required:
`spring_cloud_deployer_cloudfoundry_skipSslValidation=true`

[[batch-informational-messages]]
== Batch Informational Messages

Spring Cloud Task provides the ability for batch jobs to emit informational messages.  This
is covered in detail in the section
<<stream.adoc#stream-integration-batch-events, Spring Batch Events>>.

[[batch-failures-and-tasks]]
== Batch Job Exit Codes

As discussed before Spring Cloud Task applications support the ability to record the exit code of a task execution.
However in cases where a user is running a Spring Batch Job within a task, regardless of how the Batch Job
Execution completes the result of the task will always be zero when using default Batch/Boot behavior.  Keep in mind
that a task is a boot application and the exit code returned from the task is the same as a boot application.  So
to have your task return the exit code based on the result of the batch job execution, you will need to write your
own CommandLineRunner.
