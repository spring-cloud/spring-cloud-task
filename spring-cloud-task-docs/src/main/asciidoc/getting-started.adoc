If you're just getting started with Spring Cloud Task, this is the section
for you! Here we answer the basic "`what?`", "`how?`" and "`why?`" questions. You'll
find a gentle introduction to Spring Cloud Task.  We'll then build our first Spring Cloud
Task application, discussing some core principles as we go.

[[getting-started-introducing-spring-cloud-task]]
== Introducing Spring Cloud Task

Spring Cloud Task makes it easy to create short lived microservices.  We provide
capabilities that allow short lived JVM processes to be executed on demand in a production
environment.

[[getting-started-system-requirements]]
== System Requirements

You need Java installed (Java 7 or better, we recommend Java 8) and to build you need to have Maven installed as well.

=== Database Requirements

Spring Cloud Task uses a relational database to store the results of an executed task.
While you can begin developing a task without a database (the status of the task is logged
 as part of the task repository's updates), for production environments, you'll want to
utilize a supported database.  Below is a list of the ones currently supported:

- H2
- HSQLDB
- MySql
- Oracle
- Postgres

[[getting-started-developing-first-task]]
== Developing your first Spring Cloud Task application

A good place to start is with a simple "Hello World!" application so we'll create the
Spring Cloud Task equivalent to highlight the features of the framework.  We'll use Apache
Maven as a build tool for this project since most IDEs have good support for it.

NOTE: The spring.io web site contains many “Getting Started” guides that use Spring Boot.
If you’re looking to solve a specific problem; check there first.  You can shortcut the
steps below by going to start.spring.io and creating a new project. This will
automatically generate a new project structure so that you can start coding right the way.
Check the documentation for more details.

Before we begin, open a terminal to check that you have valid versions of Java and Maven
installed.

[source]
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_31"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_31-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.31-b07, mixed mode)

[source]
$ mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.2.3 (33f8c3e1027c3ddde99d3cdebad2656a31e8fdf4; 2014-08-11T15:58:10-05:00)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.2.3/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_31, vendor: Oracle Corporation

NOTE: This sample needs to be created in its own folder.  Subsequent instructions assume
you have created a suitable folder and that it is your "current directory".

[[getting-started-creating-the-pom]]
=== Creating the POM

We need to start by creating a Maven `pom.xml` file.  The `pom.xml` is the recipe that
will be used to build your project.  Open your favorite text editor and add the following:

[code,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
		 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		 xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

	<modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

	<groupId>com.example</groupId>
	<artifactId>myproject</artifactId>
	<packaging>jar</packaging>
	<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>

	<parent>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
		<version>1.3.2.RELEASE</version>
	</parent>

	<properties>
		<start-class>com.example.SampleTask</start-class>
	</properties>

	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>

	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>
</project>
----

This should give you a working build.  You can test it out by running `mvn package` (you
can ignore the "jar will be empty - no content was marked for inclusion!" warning for
now).

NOTE: At this point you could import the project into an IDE (most modern Java IDE's
include built-in support for Maven).  For simplicity we will continue to use a plain text
editor for this example.

[[getting-started-adding-classpath-dependencies]]
=== Adding classpath dependencies

A Spring Cloud Task is made up of a Spring Boot application that is expected to end.  In
our POM above, we created the shell of a Spring Boot application from a dependency
perspective by setting our parent to use the `spring-boot-starter-parent`.

Spring Boot provides a number of additional "Starter POMs".  Some of which are appropriate
for use within tasks (`spring-boot-starter-batch`, `spring-boot-starter-jdbc`, etc) and
some may not be ('spring-boot-starter-web` is probably not going to be used in a task).
The indicator of if a starter makes sense or not comes down to if the resulting
application will end (batch based applications typically end, the
`spring-boot-starter-web` dependency bootstraps a servlet container which probably wont').

For this example, we'll only need to add a single additional dependency, the one for
Spring Cloud Task itself:

[source,xml]
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-task-core</artifactId>
			<version>1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
		</dependency>

[[getting-started-writing-the-code]]
=== Writing the code

To finish our application, we need to create a single Java file.  Maven will compile the
sources from `src/main/java` by default so you need to create that folder structure.  Then
add a file named `src/main/java/com/example/SampleTask.java`:

[source,java]
----
package com.example;

import org.springframework.boot.*;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.task.configuration.EnableTask;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableTask
public class SampleTask {

	@Bean
	public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner() {
		return new HelloWorldCommandLineRunner();
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SampleTask.class, args);
	}

	public static class HelloWorldCommandLineRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

		@Override
		public void run(String... strings) throws Exception {
			System.out.println("Hello World!");
		}
	}
}
----

While it may not look like much, quite a bit is going on.  To read more about the Spring
Boot specifics, take a look at their reference documentation here:
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/[http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/]

[[getting-started-at-task]]
==== The @EnableTask annotation

The first non boot annotation in our example is the `@EnableTask` annotation.  This class
level annotation tells Spring Cloud Task to bootstrap it's functionality.  This occurs by
importing an additional configuration class, `SimpleTaskConfiguration` by default.  This
additional configuration registers the `TaskRepository` and the infrastructure for its
use.

Out of the box, the `TaskRepository` will use an in memory `Map` to record the results
of a task.  Obviously this isn't a practical solution for a production environment since
the `Map` goes away once the task ends.  However, for a quick getting started
experience we use this as a default as well as echoing to the logs what is being updated
in that repository.  Later in this documentation we'll cover how to customize the
configuration of the pieces provided by Spring Cloud Task.

When our sample application is run, Spring Boot will launch our
`HelloWorldCommandLineRunner` outputting our "Hello World!" message to standard out.  The
`TaskLifecyceListener` will record the start of the task and the end of the task in the
repository.

[[getting-started-main-method]]
==== The main method

The main method serves as the entry point to any java application.  Our main method
delegates to Spring Boot's `SpringApplication` class.  You can read more about it in the
Spring Boot documentation.

[[getting-started-clr]]
==== The CommandLineRunner

In Spring, there are many ways to bootstrap an application's logic.  Spring Boot provides
a convenient method of doing so in an organized manor via their `*Runner` interfaces
(`CommandLineRunner` or `ApplicationRunner`).  A well behaved task will bootstrap any
logic via one of these two runners.

The lifecycle of a task is considered from before the `*Runner#run` methods are executed
to once they are all complete.  Spring Boot allows an application to use multiple
`*Runner` implementation and Spring Cloud Task doesn't attempt to impede on this convention.

NOTE: Any processing bootstrapped from mechanisms other than a `CommandLineRunner` or
`ApplicationRunner` (using `InitializingBean#afterPropertiesSet` for example) will not be
 recorded by Spring Cloud Task.

[[getting-started-running-the-example]]
=== Running the example

At this point, your application should work.  Since this application is Spring Boot based,
 we can run it from the command line via the command `$ mvn spring-boot:run` from the root
 of our applicaiton:

[source]

$ mvn clean spring-boot:run

If you notice, there are three lines of interest in the above output:

* `SimpleTaskRepository` logged out the creation of the entry in the `TaskRepository`.
* The execution of our `CommandLineRunner`, demonstrated by the "Helo World!" output.
* `SimpleTaskREpository` logging the completion of the task in the `TaskRepository`.
