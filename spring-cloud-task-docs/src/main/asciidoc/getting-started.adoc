If you are just getting started with Spring Cloud Task, you should read this section.
Here, we answer the basic "`what?`", "`how?`", and "`why?`" questions. We start with a
gentle introduction to Spring Cloud Task. We then build a Spring Cloud Task application,
discussing some core principles as we go.

[[getting-started-introducing-spring-cloud-task]]
== Introducing Spring Cloud Task

Spring Cloud Task makes it easy to create short-lived microservices. It provides
capabilities that let short lived JVM processes be executed on demand in a production
environment.

[[getting-started-system-requirements]]
== System Requirements

You need to have Java installed (Java 8 or better). To build, you need to have Maven
installed as well.

=== Database Requirements

Spring Cloud Task uses a relational database to store the results of an executed task.
While you can begin developing a task without a database (the status of the task is logged
as part of the task repository's updates), for production environments, you want to
use a supported database. Spring Cloud Task currently supports the following databases:

* DB2
* H2
* HSQLDB
* MySql
* Oracle
* Postgres
* SqlServer

[[getting-started-developing-first-task]]
== Developing Your First Spring Cloud Task Application

A good place to start is with a simple "`Hello, World!`" application, so we create the
Spring Cloud Task equivalent to highlight the features of the framework. Most IDEs have
good support for Apache Maven, so we use it as the build tool for this project.

NOTE: The spring.io web site contains many https://spring.io/guides[“`Getting Started`”
guides] that use Spring Boot. If you need to solve a specific problem, check there first.
You can shortcut the following steps by going to the
https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr] and creating a new project. Doing so
automatically generates a new project structure so that you can start coding right away.
We recommend experimenting with the Spring Initializr to become familiar with it.

[[getting-started-creating-project]]
=== Creating the Spring Task Project using Spring Initializr
Now we can create and test an application that prints `Hello, World!` to the console.

To do so:

. Visit the link:https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initialzr] site.
.. Create a new Maven project with a *Group* name of `io.spring.demo` and an *Artifact* name of `helloworld`.
.. In the Dependencies text box, type `task` and then select the `Cloud Task` dependency.
.. In the Dependencies text box, type `jdbc` and then select the `JDBC` dependency.
.. In the Dependencies text box, type `h2` and then select the `H2`. (or your favorite database)
.. Click the *Generate Project* button
. Unzip the timestamp.zip file and import the project into your favorite IDE.

[[getting-started-writing-the-code]]
=== Writing the Code

To finish our application, we need to update the generated `HelloworldApplication` with the following contents so that it launches a Task.
[source,java]
----
package io.spring.demo.helloworld;

import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
public class HelloworldApplication {

	@Bean
	public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner() {
		return new HelloWorldCommandLineRunner();
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(HelloworldApplication.class, args);
	}

	public static class HelloWorldCommandLineRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

		@Override
		public void run(String... strings) throws Exception {
			System.out.println("Hello, World!");
		}
	}
}
----

While it may seem small, quite a bit is going on. For more about Spring
Boot specifics, see the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/[Spring Boot reference documentation].

Now we can open the `application.properties` file in `src/main/resources`.
We need to configure two properties in `application.properties`:

* `application.name`: To set the application name (which is translated to the task name)
* `logging.level`: To set the logging for Spring Cloud Task to `DEBUG` in order to
get a view of what is going on.

The following example shows how to do both:


[source]
----
logging.level.org.springframework.cloud.task=DEBUG
spring.application.name=helloWorld
----

[[getting-started-at-task]]
==== Task Auto Configuration

When including Spring Cloud Task Starter dependency, Task auto configures all beans to bootstrap it's functionality.
Part of this configuration registers the `TaskRepository` and the infrastructure for its use.

In our demo, the `TaskRepository` uses an embedded H2 database to record the results
of a task. This H2 embedded database is not a practical solution for a production environment, since
the H2 DB goes away once the task ends. However, for a quick getting-started
experience, we can use this in our example as well as echoing to the logs what is being updated
in that repository. In the <<features-configuration>> section (later in this
documentation), we cover how to customize the configuration of the pieces provided by
Spring Cloud Task.

When our sample application runs, Spring Boot launches our `HelloWorldCommandLineRunner`
and outputs our "`Hello, World!`" message to standard out. The `TaskLifecycleListener`
records the start of the task and the end of the task in the repository.

[[getting-started-main-method]]
==== The main method

The main method serves as the entry point to any java application.  Our main method
delegates to Spring Boot's https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-spring-application.html[SpringApplication] class.

[[getting-started-clr]]
==== The CommandLineRunner

Spring includes many ways to bootstrap an application's logic. Spring Boot provides
a convenient method of doing so in an organized manner through its `*Runner` interfaces
(`CommandLineRunner` or `ApplicationRunner`). A well behaved task can bootstrap any
logic by using one of these two runners.

The lifecycle of a task is considered from before the `*Runner#run` methods are executed
to once they are all complete. Spring Boot lets an application use multiple
`*Runner` implementations, as does Spring Cloud Task.

NOTE: Any processing bootstrapped from mechanisms other than a `CommandLineRunner` or
`ApplicationRunner` (by using `InitializingBean#afterPropertiesSet` for example) is not
 recorded by Spring Cloud Task.

[[getting-started-running-the-example]]
=== Running the Example

At this point, our application should work.  Since this application is Spring Boot-based,
we can run it from the command line by using `$ mvn spring-boot:run` from the root
of our application, as shown (with its output) in the following example:

[source]
----
$ mvn clean spring-boot:run

----

The preceding output has three lines that of interest to us here:

* `SimpleTaskRepository` logged the creation of the entry in the `TaskRepository`.
* The execution of our `CommandLineRunner`, demonstrated by the "`Hello, World!`" output.
* `SimpleTaskRepository` logs the completion of the task in the `TaskRepository`.

NOTE: A simple task application can be found in the samples module of the Spring Cloud
Task Project
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-task/tree/master/spring-cloud-task-samples/timestamp[here].
