= TaskProcessor

Is a stream processor that will accept messages with a string payload and create a
`TaskLaunchRequest` that it will send to the next app in the stream.  The payload of the
message that is sent will be added to the properties of the `TaskLaunchRequest` under
the `payload` key.

By default the processor will add the timestamp-task sample coordinates if no task is
specified.

NOTE: if using defaults make sure to install the timestamp-task into your local maven repo
by executing the following build in the timestamp-task module:

[source,shell,indent=2]
----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----

== The parameters offered by the TaskProcessor are as follows:
* *group* establishes the group for the task maven coordinates.   Default is `io.spring`.
* *artifact* establishes the artifact for the task maven coordinates.  Default is `timestamp-task`.
* *classifiers* establishes the classifier for the task maven coordinates.  Default is null.
* *extension* establishes the extension for the task maven coordinates.  Default is jar.
* *data-source-url* sets the spring_datasource_url for the task.  Default is null.
* *data-source-driver-class-name* establishes the spring_datasource_driverClassName for the task.  Default is null.
* *data-source-user-name* establishes the spring_datasource_username for the task.  Default is null.
